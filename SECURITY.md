## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

There are two supported reporting channels. The GitHub private security
advisory system is preferred because it provides a structured, auditable
workflow; email is available as a fallback for reporters who cannot use it.

### 1. GitHub private security advisory (preferred)

👉 **[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/queenannaE/pulsar-contracts/security/advisories/new)**

This opens a private advisory on the `queenannaE/pulsar-contracts`
repository. Only the repository maintainers can see your report.

### 2. Email the maintainers directly

Send your report to **euniceoyiefieo@gmail.com** with the subject line
`[SECURITY] Pulsar — <short summary>`. Please encrypt sensitive details
with the maintainer's PGP key if you have it; otherwise plain email is fine.

### What to include

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected versions
- Any suggested mitigations (optional)

### Response SLA

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Acknowledgement | Within **48 hours** of submission |
| Initial assessment | Within **5 business days** |
| Fix or mitigation | Within **90 days** (critical issues prioritised) |

We will keep you informed of progress throughout the process and credit you in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

### Coordinated disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure model. Reporters are asked to give
maintainers a reasonable window (default 90 days, or until a fix is shipped —
whichever comes first) before publicly disclosing the issue. We will not
take action against good-faith security research that respects this window.

## Scope

This policy covers the smart contract code in this repository. Issues in third-party dependencies (e.g. `soroban-sdk`) should be reported to their respective maintainers.

## Mainnet Security Audit (SEC-001)

The Pulsar contract handles real token transfers. **An independent security audit by a recognised Soroban/Stellar smart contract auditor is required before any mainnet deployment.**

All Critical and High severity findings must be resolved before deployment. The full audit report will be published in [`docs/security-audit.md`](docs/security-audit.md) once completed.

See [`docs/security-audit.md`](docs/security-audit.md) for the full audit scope, recommended auditors, pre-audit checklist, and deployment gate criteria.
