# Subscription / Recurring Payment Guide

This guide documents the recurring-payment ("subscription") feature of the
payment processing contract and, in particular, the off-chain scheduling
requirement called for by MISC-005.

## Overview

Soroban contracts have no built-in scheduler or cron-like mechanism — a
contract cannot wake itself up and execute code at a future ledger close. To
support subscriptions, the contract exposes a set of functions that an
**external, off-chain scheduler service must invoke on a timer**. The
contract itself only enforces correctness (duplicate-ID checks, interval
guards, authorization, status transitions); it never initiates a charge on
its own.

Implementation: `contracts/payment-processing-contract/src/lib.rs`
- `create_subscription` (lib.rs:1752)
- `cancel_subscription` (lib.rs:1802)
- `process_subscription_payment` (lib.rs:1844)
- `get_subscription` / merchant subscription listing (lib.rs, following
  `process_subscription_payment`)

Types: `contracts/payment-processing-contract/src/types.rs`
- `SubscriptionPlan { interval: u64, amount: i128, token: Address }` (types.rs:215)
- `SubscriptionStatus { Active, Cancelled }` (types.rs:223)
- `SubscriptionState { subscription_id, payer, merchant, plan, status, created_at, last_charged_at }` (types.rs:230)

## Lifecycle

1. **Create** — `create_subscription(payer, merchant, subscription_id, plan)`.
   `payer` must sign (`require_auth`). Fails with `SubscriptionAlreadyExists`
   if the ID is reused, `MerchantNotFound` / `MerchantInactive` if the
   merchant isn't a valid active merchant, and `InvalidInput` if
   `plan.interval == 0` or `plan.amount <= 0`.
2. **Charge** — `process_subscription_payment(caller, subscription_id)` must
   be called once per billing interval by an off-chain scheduler. **`caller`
   must be the subscription's `payer` address** and must provide
   authorization for that call (the scheduler needs a signed payer
   authorization, e.g. via a pre-signed auth entry or a payer-operated bot —
   it cannot act as an arbitrary third party). The first charge is always
   allowed (`last_charged_at == 0`); every subsequent charge requires
   `now >= last_charged_at + plan.interval`, otherwise the call fails with
   `SubscriptionIntervalNotElapsed`. Each successful charge transfers
   `plan.amount` of `plan.token` from payer to merchant and emits a
   `subscription_charged` event.
3. **Cancel** — `cancel_subscription(caller, subscription_id)`, callable only
   by the payer. Once cancelled, further `process_subscription_payment` calls
   fail with `SubscriptionNotActive`.

## Off-chain scheduler requirements

A production deployment MUST run a scheduler process that:

- Tracks each active `SubscriptionState` (via `get_subscription` /
  merchant-subscription listing) and its `plan.interval` /
  `last_charged_at`.
- Invokes `process_subscription_payment` once the interval has elapsed,
  with the payer's authorization attached to the transaction.
- Handles `SubscriptionIntervalNotElapsed` (safe to retry later) and
  `SubscriptionNotActive` (stop scheduling — the payer cancelled) without
  treating them as unexpected errors.
- Reconciles missed charges after downtime: because the interval guard only
  checks `now >= last_charged_at + interval`, a late scheduler run simply
  charges once for the elapsed interval; it does not automatically
  back-charge multiple missed periods, so the scheduler is responsible for
  deciding whether to catch up or skip missed cycles per its own billing
  policy.

There is currently no reference scheduler implementation in this repository;
the off-chain indexer service (`indexer/`) is a reasonable place to add one in
a future iteration, but it is out of scope for this contract-level change.

## Events

| Event                   | Payload                          | Emitted by |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| `subscription_created`  | `subscription_id`                | `create_subscription` |
| `subscription_cancelled`| `subscription_id`                | `cancel_subscription` |
| `subscription_charged`  | `(subscription_id, amount)`      | `process_subscription_payment` |

## Tests

Unit tests covering the lifecycle (creation, duplicate IDs, inactive
merchants, cancellation, first charge, interval enforcement, and charging a
cancelled subscription) live in
`contracts/payment-processing-contract/src/test.rs`, e.g.
`test_create_subscription_success`, `test_cancel_subscription_wrong_payer_fails`,
`test_process_subscription_payment_before_interval_fails`.
